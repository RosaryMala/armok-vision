1.3.6.3 (April 24, 2013):
  MacOS support! A universal binary, libenet.dylib, is included.
  
  Linux support! Specifically...
  libenet.so.1 (package libenet1a) is now searched for, in addition to the Windows DLLs.
  The earlier ENet 1.3.3 should work with this version, except for Peer's SetPingInterval and SetTimeouts methods.
  Implemented a workaround to ENet 1.3.6 EINTR (Unix signals) behavior.
  Implemented a workaround to Mono P/Invoke bug 11899.
  Special thanks to Random for testing this for me.
